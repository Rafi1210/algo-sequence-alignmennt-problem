# Sequence Alignmennt Problem
<br>
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is employed for global sequence alignment. It operates by
creating a penalty matrix to assess the cost of aligning each pair of characters in the input
sequences. The traceback matrix is then used to backtrack and determine the optimal alignment.
